# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

This project is the first project from from Udacity's [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891). "In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face; examples of these keypoints are displayed below."

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks:

`Notebook 1: Loading and Visualizing Data.` Load and Visualizing the Data and creating the Dataset classes and Transformations

`Notebook 2: Define the Network Architecture` Define the Convolutional Neural Network, Batch and Loading the data, and training the network

`Notebook 3: Facial Keypoint Detection, Complete Pipeline` Loading in a trained model and Detect and display the predicted keypoint

`Notebook 4: Fun with Keypoints` Useing facial filters to add sunglasses to a face in an image



### Data

All of the data that is needed to train the neural network is in the subdirectory `data`. In this folder are training and tests set of image/keypoint data, and their respective csv files. This will be further explored in Notebook 1: Loading and Visualizing Data.
